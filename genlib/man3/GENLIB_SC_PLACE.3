.SH NAME
GENLIB_SC_PLACE \- place an instance in the current figure at absolute coordinates
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.if n \{\
.ft B \}
.if t \{\
.ft CR \}
#include <genlib.h>
void GENLIB_SC_PLACE(insname, symetry, x, y)
char \(**insname;

long x,y;
.ft R
.fi
.so man1/alc_origin.1
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP 20
\fIinsname\fP
Name to be given to the instance on the model
.TP
\fIsymetry\fP
Geometrical operation to be performed on the instance before being placed
.TP
\fIx, y\fP
Coordinates of the lower left corner of the abutment box of the model in
the current figure
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fISC_PLACE\fP add an instance in the current cell. The bottom left corner
of the instance is placed, after being symetrized and/or rotated,
at \fI(x, y)\fP
coordinates. The placement takes place only if the netlist is up to day,
because the model of the instance is seeked there, in order to ensure
consistency.
The placed instance becomes the new "reference instance", used in
the relative placement functions.
.br
The \fIsymetry\fP argument can take eight legal values :
.TP 20
\fBNOSYM\fP
no geometrical operation is performed
.TP
\fBSYM_Y\fP
Y becomes -Y, that means toward X axe symetry
.TP
\fBSYM_X\fP
X becomes -X, that means toward Y axe symetry
.TP
\fBSYMXY\fP
X becomes -X, Y becomes -Y
.TP
\fBROT_P\fP
a positive 90 degrees rotation take place
.TP
\fBROT_M\fP
a negative 90 degrees rotation take place
.TP
\fBSY_RP\fP
Y becomes -Y, and then a positive 90 degrees rotation take place
.TP
\fBSY_RM\fP
Y becomes -Y, and then a negative 90 degrees rotation take place
.SH ERRORS
.if n \{\
.ft B \}
.if t \{\
.ft CR \}
"GENLIB_SC_PLACE impossible : missing GENLIB_DEF_PHFIG"
.ft R
.RS
No figure has been yet specified by a call to \fBDEF_PHFIG\fP. So it isn't
possible to place an instance inside it.
you must call \fBDEF_PHFIG\fP before any other layout action.
.RE
.if n \{\
.ft B \}
.if t \{\
.ft CR \}
"GENLIB_SC_PLACE impossible : missing GENLIB_DEF_LOFIG"
.ft R
.RS
The current netlist figure is not define, so \fBSC_PLACE\fP doesn't know
where to pick up the model. A \fBDEF_LOFIG\fP or a \fBDEF_PHSC\fP
is to be performed to avoid this error.
.RE
.if n \{\
.ft B \}
.if t \{\
.ft CR \}
"GENLIB_SC_PLACE impossible : no logical instance insname"
.ft R
.RS
The instance \fIinsname\fP does not exist in the netlist representation
of the cell. It may lead us to believe that there is a consistency
problem between the two representation of this cell.
.RE
.if n \{\
.ft B \}
.if t \{\
.ft CR \}
"illegal addphins : transformation is x in insname"
.ft R
.RS
The \fIsymetry\fP parameter is not one of the define given, but has the
integer value \fBx\fP.
