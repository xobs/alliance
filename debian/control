Description: VLSI CAD Tools
 Alliance is  a complete set of free  CAD tools and portable  libraries for VLSI
 design. It includes  a VHDL compiler and simulator,  logic synthesis tools, and
 automatic place and route tools.
   A  complete set  of  portable CMOS  libraries  is provided,  including a  RAM
 generator, a ROM generator and a data-path compiler.
   Alliance is the result of more than ten years effort spent at ASIM department
 of LIP6 laboratory of the Pierre et Marie Curie University (Paris VI, France).
   Alliance has been used for research  projects such as the 875 000 transistors
 StaCS  superscalar microprocessor  and  400 000  transistors  IEEE Gigabit  HSL
 Router.

 Alliance provides CAD tools covering most of all the digital design flow:
  * VHDL Compilation and Simulation
  * Model checking and formal proof
  * RTL and Logic synthesis 
  * Data-Path compilation
  * Macro-cells generation
  * Place and route
  * Layout edition
  * Netlist extraction and verification
  * Design rules checking
