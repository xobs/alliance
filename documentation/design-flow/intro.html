<h1>Alliance provides a software environment for the development of CAD tools:</h1>
<ul>
	<li>More than 60 libraries written in C language.
	Those libraries contain the definition of several data structures and methods 
	allowing to describe circuits from the RTL view up to the physical view.
	Thoses data structures covered all the design flow and can be used
	by developpers to implement CAD applications.
	Those libraries contain also parsers and drivers for several standard file
	format.</li>

	<li>More than 650 man pages describing the programming interface of
	those libraries</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h1>Alliance provides CAD tools covering most of all the digital design flow:</h1>
<ul>
	<li>VHDL Compilation and Simulation</li>
	<li>Model checking and formal proof</li>
	<li>RTL and Logic synthesis</li>
	<li>Data-Path compilation</li>
	<li>Macro-cells generation</li>
	<li>Place and route</li>
	<li>Layout edition</li>
	<li>Netlist extraction and verification</li>
	<li>Design rules checking</li>
	<li>etc ...</li>
</ul>

This is a MIPS-R3000 of 52000 transistors, that has been completely designed
using Alliance CAD tools

<h1>Alliance provides also a complete set of portable CMOS libraries:</h1>
<ul>
	<li>standard cells</li>
	<li>specific cells used by the generators (RAM/ROM/etc ...)</li>
	<li>symbolic pad cells</li>
</ul>

<em>The Alliance CAD system is used in more than 80 Universities all around the world
	for teaching and research purposes.
</em>
<br>
<em>Alliance is the result of a twelve year effort spent at ASIM department of LIP6
	laboratory of the Pierre et Marie Curie University
