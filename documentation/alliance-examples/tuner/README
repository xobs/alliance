This directory contains a small design example done using Alliance.
It is in French, but that's life.
The example starts from a behavior and ends up in a layout in a smooth
(too smooth to be honest) manner.
All files in this directory are GPLed, even if not marked as such, and
all have been authored by me, which is not so bad (I've even seen worse)

A complete run is done using ./build_tuner, but I would advise to
copy/paste from this file to understand what's going on.

Have fun,
