This directory contains the VHDL description of an 4 bits divisor and
the associated stimuli file, and also a configuration file for IO

The Makefile set environment variables properly and run Alliance tools, 
following each step of the design flow from VHDL up to real layout in a
 pseudo 0.35 techno.
