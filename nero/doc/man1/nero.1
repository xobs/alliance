.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
nero is a simple router suited for small
academic designs. Currently it can process designs of size up to
4K gates.
.SS "GLOBAL ROUTING"
.PP
A design is considered as \fBbig\fR if it
contains nets which half perimeter is greater than 800 lambdas.
Global routing is used on big designs.
.PP
In nero, "global routing" means that
the longuests nets are completely routed in a first step with only
routing layers numbers 3 & 4. Then the smaller nets are routed with all
avalaibles layers. This implies that when global routing is
used, the number of routing layers is forced to at least 4.
In each step, the nets are routed from the shortest to the
longuest with the same routing algorithm.
.SH "INVOCATION"
.PP
nero mandatory arguments\ :
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fInetlist\fR\ : the name of
the design, without any extention. Please note that unless a
\fB-p\fR \fIplacement\fR option
is given, the file holding the placement is expected to have the
same name as the netlist file (short of the extention).
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fIlayout\fR\ : the name of
the resulting routed layout. Be careful of not giving the same
name as the netlist, in this case the initial placement will be
silently overwritten.
.PP
.PP
nero optionnals arguments\ :
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fB-h\fR, \fB--help\fR\ :
print help.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fB-v\fR, \fB--verbose\fR\ :
be verbose.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fB-V\fR, \fB--very-verbose\fR\ :
be unbearably verbose.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fB-c\fR, \fB--core-dump\fR\ :
do not prevent the generation of core dumps in case of a crash.
Mostly used during the development stage.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fB-2\fR,
\fB-3\fR,
\fB-4\fR,
\fB-5\fR,
\fB-6\fR\ : set the numbers of layers
used for routing. The default for small designs is 2 and 4 for big
ones. When global routing took place, the router will uses at least
4 routing layers.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fB-L\fR, \fB--local\fR\ :
turn off the global routing stage, whatever the size of the design.
Be warned that this will enormously slow down the routing process.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fB-G\fR, \fB--global\fR\ :
turn on the global routing regardless of the size of the design.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fB-p\fR \fIplacement\fR,
\fB--place\fR \fIplacement\fR\ :
specify a name for the placement file different from the netlist
name.

.SH "EXAMPLE"
.PP
Route the netlist amd2901_core.vst, using
the placement file amd2901_core_p.ap and store the
result in amd2901_core_r.
